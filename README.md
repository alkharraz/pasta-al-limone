You'll also need a large pot to boil your pasta with and another big pan to prepare the pasta in.

How to:

1. Fill the large pot with water and let it come to boil then add salt and then your pasta (look at your pasta package to know for how long you should boil your pasta -*Pro tip: pluck a strand of pasta and taste it so you know if it's cooked)
